## Credit Risk Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing credit risk. The notebook is written in Python and uses various libraries and packages such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. Additionally, the repository includes a dataset, a requirements.txt file, and an image file.

### Getting Started
To get started with the analysis, you'll need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/credit-risk-analysis.git
Once you have cloned the repository, you can install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
###Data
The data used for this analysis is located in the data directory. The credit-data.csv file contains information about credit applicants, including their age, income, and credit score.

###Notebook
The analysis is contained in the credit-risk-analysis.ipynb notebook, which is located in the root directory. The notebook is organized as follows:

Data Loading: Loading the dataset and displaying basic information about the dataset
Data Exploration: Visualizing and analyzing the distribution of features in the dataset
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features.
Feature Selection: Using feature selection techniques to identify the most important features for predicting credit risk.
Model Building: Building a logistic regression model to predict credit risk
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Conclusion
This repository provides a notebook for analyzing credit risk using machine learning techniques. The code and data can be used as a starting point for more complex analyses or can be adapted to suit specific use cases. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact us. Additionally, you can find a visual representation of the data exploration in data-exploration.png file.
